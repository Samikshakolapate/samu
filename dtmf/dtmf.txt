The system allows user to send commands from their cell phones to control various home appliances such as bulb,fan etc. Commands are sent via cell phone's numeric code dialling capability. The system is equipped with DTMF decoder and relay module for controlling any appliance.The program code is fed onto the microcontroller.The main advantage of the system is its vast range.We can track the status and control our home appliance from anywhere.
